Project Summary: Data Wrangling and Analysis of @dog_rates Twitter Archive
The project focuses on data wrangling, analysis, and visualization of the tweet archive from the popular Twitter account @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. This account is known for its humorous dog ratings, with ratings typically having a denominator of 10 and numerators often exceeding 10. The project utilizes Python and its libraries, along with SQL, to gather data from various sources, assess its quality and tidiness, and perform data wrangling.

Project Objectives:
Gather data from multiple sources, including the provided tweet archive from WeRateDogs.
Assess the quality and tidiness of the collected data.
Clean the data by addressing issues identified during the assessment process.
Document the entire data wrangling process in a Jupyter Notebook.
Perform analyses and visualizations using Python and its libraries, as well as SQL, to gain insights into the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.
Dataset Overview:
The dataset used for this project is the WeRateDogs tweet archive, comprising over 5000 tweets as of August 1, 2017. The archive contains essential tweet data such as tweet ID, timestamp, and text. The tweets provide ratings for dogs, often accompanied by humorous comments. The ratings consistently have a denominator of 10, while the numerators are usually higher than 10. The Twitter archive was made exclusively available by WeRateDogs for this project, and it serves as the primary data source for analysis and visualization.

The project involves utilizing Python's libraries and Jupyter Notebook to wrangle the data, address data quality and tidiness issues, and perform exploratory data analysis. The goal is to gain insights into the ratings and trends of the dogs rated by WeRateDogs, leveraging visualizations and analytical techniques.

By completing this project, proficiency in data wrangling techniques, data analysis using Python and effective communication of findings through visualizations and documentation will be demonstrated.
